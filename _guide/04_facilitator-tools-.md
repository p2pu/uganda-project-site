Facilitators can:

- Use a step by step dialog to guide them through creating a learning circle
- See who signed up, when meetings are scheduled, who can come, etc
- Send messages to learners
- Customize weekly reminders
- Capture feedback after a meeting to gather and share reflections
- Complete a survey on their experience facilitating a learning circle
- Generate a report at the end of the learning circle

Using P2PU tools is not required, but by using tools you have a system to collect information about your work that can be shared for reporting. You can also find resources and support from others in the community.

Learners do not need a P2PU account in order to join a learning circle.

To facilitate or organize learning circles, you’ll first need to create a P2PU account, which you can do from the P2PU homepage. After setting your password, you will be logged in and redirected to your learning circle dashboard.

The tools are hosted online and can be accessed from [www.p2pu.org](http://www.p2pu.org)

## Facilitator Dashboard

The Facilitator Dashboard is the space you see when you sign in to your P2PU account. From here, you can create and manage your learning circles and see what else is happening around the community. 

My Learning Circles
This section of your Dashboard shows the learning circles you are facilitating. One tab lists your Active & Upcoming learning circles, and a second tab lists your Completed learning circles. If you don’t have any yet, click “Start a learning circle” to create one.

Courses I've Added
As a facilitator, you can add online courses to the P2PU platform to use in a learning circle. This table shows the courses that you have added, along with a link to go to the course editing page for each one. Visit our website to Add a Course.

My Team's Learning Circles
This section shows all of the learning circles facilitated by members of your Team.

## Creating Learning Circles

P2PU offers a free system for creating and managing learning circle meetings. Once you've created a P2PU account and decided what learning circle you want to run, you can create your learning circle and publish it to the world.

### Walkthrough: How to Create a Learning Circle
Creating a learning circle is a 5-step process.
1. **Select a Course:** Identify the learning materials you'll be using
1. **Find a Location:** Share the details of where you'll be meeting (in person or online)
1. **Select Meeting Dates:** Choose the dates and times of your meetings (flexibly; you can update these later)
1. **Customize the Sign-Up Page**: Write any details about your learning circle (welcome message, materials needed, etc) to customize the public sign-up page
1. **Finalize:** Privately reflect on your goals for the learning circle and optionally ask for help if you need it.

Once you complete the creation process and publish your learning circle (either as a draft or a public circle), your sign-up page will automatically be generated (see above image for an example).

You’ll receive a confirmation email, which includes the link to your sign-up page and a number of other resources. The P2PU Welcome Committee (a mix of P2PU staff and community members) will be copied on the email; if you asked for any help on Step 5, someone will reach out to ensure that your concerns are addressed before the learning circle begins. 

You can watch a video about the process here: [https://youtu.be/860ITkW8WmU](https://youtu.be/860ITkW8WmU)

## [Management Page](https://docs.p2pu.org/tools-and-resources/tools-for-learning-circles/managing-learning-circles)

The top section of the page shows a preview of the learning circle's information: title, image, facilitator info, link to the course materials, and meeting details. 
Below that is a yellow bar containing the following tools:
- **Edit:** Return to the 5-step learning circle creation form to update any information previously entered.
- **View:** See the live learning circle sign-up page.
- **Add Meeting: **Quickly add a new meeting to the learning circle. This will add a section for that meeting on the management page and automatically generate an editable reminder message for that meeting.
- **Close Signup:** Turn off the registration form on the sign-up page. (If signup is closed, the button will change to Open Signup and can be used to activate registration again anytime.)
- **Delete:** Delete the learning circle from public view and remove the records of the learning circle and registered learners from the P2PU database.

The Add Learner button can be used to manually add participants to a learning circle. This only allows for adding a participant's name and contact information, not their answers to the sign-up questions. Note that this will automatically send a welcome message to the participant to let them know they've joined a learning circle.

To **add multiple learners** to your learning circle at the same time, click the “Add Learner” button and choose “Click here to add multiple learners at once.” This feature is particularly useful for learning circles that use physical signup sheets for learners.

Meeting reminders are automatically generated when a meeting is created, either during the learning circle's initial creation or when added afterwards. These messages can be edited from the Messages table or in the individual meeting's section of the meeting manager. 

Manual messages allow the facilitator to send out information to all registered learners at any time via email or SMS. These messages will be sent immediately and cannot be scheduled to go out in the future. Manual messages have P2PU branding on them, and they will CC the facilitator and BCC all other recipients.
