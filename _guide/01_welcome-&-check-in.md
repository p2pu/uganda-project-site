This facilitator training guide was developed by P2PU for the Digital Skills @ Your Local library program to support the training and onboarding of new learning circle facilitators in Uganda. You can complete this training by yourself or in a group. When you finish, you will become part of a national community of facilitators and you will be able to facilitate learning circles in any topic that you choose.

This facilitator training is just one part of the  Digital Skills @ Your Local Library program.  You can  review the other ICT Training materials for this program included in the additional resources section of this guide. 

If you are working through this guide with a group, introduce yourself to one another and share something that you learned recently. This is an important exercise to emphasize that everybody has things they want to learn, and knowledge and experiences  that they can share. Together, a group of people can learn almost anything together. 

For assistance using this guide or questions, you can reach our team at thepeople@P2pu.org
