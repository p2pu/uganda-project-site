title: "Welcome & Check-in"

This facilitator training guide was developed by P2PU for the Digital Skills @ Your library program to support the training and onboarding of new learning circle facilitators in Uganda. You can complete this training by yourself or in a group. When you finish, you will become part of a national community of facilitators and you will be able to facilitate learning circles in any topic that you choose.

If you are working through this guide with a group, introduce yourself to one another and share something that you learned recently. This is an important exercise to emphasize that everybody has things they want to learn, and knowledge and experiences  that they can share. Together, a group of people can learn almost anything together.
