## Setting Intent

Learning circles work best when learners can identify what motivates their participation, and the same is true for the facilitator. As you begin thinking about the learning circles you want to run, here are some questions you can ask to set your intent:

- What are you personally hoping to achieve by facilitating a learning circle?
- What need are you trying to address in your community?
- Who do you expect to reach?
- How will you know if your experiment was a success?

Once you’ve established your personal goals for a learning circle, you’ll want to start sharing your ideas and gathering buy-in from people who will help you along the way. This may include reaching out to people who you think might want to participate, organizations that might help you promote your learning circle, or a group that you are part of that can give you feedback on your idea. You are also, of course, welcome to reach out to P2PU at any time if you want our input!

## Certificates & Accreditation

P2PU does not officially issue any kind of accreditation or formal education certificates for participation in learning circles. Some courses offer various types of endorsement though learners often have to pay the course provider for a copy.
A number of facilitators like to give certificates at the end of a learning circle to help connote a sense of achievement and stronger connection between the library/learning center and learner. 

If you want to recognize and celebrate learners’ achievements, you can use or customize our[ ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dYfKZDTG5KBSzBsq6gxXxkjIDLbQD06athk3IN_I2AU/edit?usp=sharing)[certificate template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dYfKZDTG5KBSzBsq6gxXxkjIDLbQD06athk3IN_I2AU/edit?usp=sharing).


**Message Templates**
In addition to flyers and online promotion, you may want to reach out directly to your partners, neighbors, and constituents through email or social media. Below are some template messages you can use or modify to advertise your learning circle:

Got a mailing list for your organization? Here's a starting template for finding potential learners:
Are you interested in learning about [topic] but don’t want to study alone? Why not join our learning circle and study face-to-face with your peers?
From [date] to [date] we’ll be meeting at [venue] to work together through a course on [subject] in a supportive, peer-based group. We won’t have a teacher—we’ll use the online course and our personal experiences to learn together.
There are no prerequisites for the course, but access to a laptop and some experience of using the internet would be helpful.
