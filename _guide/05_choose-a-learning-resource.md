Creating a learning circle with our tools can be very quick once you have gathered the information you need. Choosing a course can be the hardest part. Here are some tips to help.

Many facilitators use free online courses for subject material because they are designed in a linear format that is easily adaptable to group study. While these so-called MOOCs ("Massive open online courses") work quite well as the content basis for learning circles, there is a broad world of openly-available information that comes in all shapes and sizes. With some time and practice, nearly any learning resource can be adapted to the learning circle model, from YouTube playlists to books.

Regardless of where the content comes from, there is no such thing as a perfect course! No matter how well the content is arranged, a course will never know you as a person, help you make decisions, or tell you when you need to look for answers somewhere else. The learning circle format and the power of peer learning do a lot of work to create a great learning experience. At its best, a course is a starting point for a community of learners to reach a common goal, wherever that path may lead.

## Topic Guides

Our topic guides help facilitators choose courses related to popular topics, and they include helpful practices and additional readings suggested by our community.

You can browse them here: [Topic Guides](https://www.p2pu.org/en/topics/)

## P2PU learning resource library

P2PU maintains a space where the learning circle community can collect and share open courses found from across the web. With a few exceptions, P2PU does not create or own this content—it is primarily a curated list. Materials added to this list are moderated and removed if they are duplicated, no longer available, or otherwise inappropriate for learning circles.

## Adding New Resources

Facilitators are not limited to the materials in the P2PU[ ](https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-resources/)[learning resource library](https://www.p2pu.org/en/learning-resources/). Anybody with a P2PU account can add a learning resource to the P2PU library by filling out the "<a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/course/create/" target="_blank">Add a Resource</a>" form which asks for the following information:
- **Title**
- **Creator** (e.g. MIT, University of Michigan, Khan Academy)
- **Format** (the type of resource)
- **URL** Where the resource (or information about the resource, such as a publisher's description of a book) can be accessed
- **Description** (Write 1-2 sentences describing what people will learn from this resource. This is what learners will see when signing up for learning circles, and what facilitators will see when selecting a resource.)
- **Topics** (Add your resource to one of P2PU’s existing[ ](https://www.p2pu.org/en/topics/)[topic guides](https://www.p2pu.org/en/topics/).)
- **Keywords** (Select or create a few keywords that will help learners and future facilitators find this resource.)
- **Language**
- **License**

## [Facilitator Guides](https://docs.p2pu.org/courses/facilitator-guides)

In some cases, other facilitators may have worked through a course and documented their process for working through the materials using a **facilitator guide**. New facilitators can benefit by using a facilitator guide, which includes the notes and session order of a previous facilitator.  Facilitator guides can also be used as a way to document multiple resources that can be used for a learning circle instead of one online course.
 
Here are two examples of Facilitator Guides built specifically for Uganda:
 
 

Liquid Soap Production is a custom course built from resources found by a facilitator, and the Fundamentals of Public Speaking  is a guide to using an existing online course.
