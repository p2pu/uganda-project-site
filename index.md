P2PU and Uganda: Learning Circles
=================================

P2PU (Peer 2 Peer University) is a global community of learners who come together to learn and grow together. One of their initiatives is to support learning circles in various communities around the world, including Uganda.

Learning circles are groups of people who come together to learn something new in a collaborative and supportive environment. These circles meet weekly for 6-8 weeks and are free to join. In Uganda, learning circles often take place in libraries, where community members can come together and access resources to support their learning.

Joining a learning circle in Uganda is a great way to connect with your neighbors and explore new topics in a structured and supportive environment. Whether you want to learn a new language, explore a new hobby, or gain new skills for your career, there is likely a learning circle in Uganda that can help you achieve your goals.

So why not join a learning circle today and start your journey of lifelong learning?

Facilitating a learning circle can be a rewarding experience, both for the facilitator and the participants. As a facilitator, your role is to create a safe and supportive environment where everyone can contribute and learn from one another. Here are some tips for facilitating a successful learning circle:

1.    Define the purpose and goals of the learning circle: Before starting a learning circle, it's important to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. What are the learning objectives? What topics will be covered? What resources will be needed? Defining these goals up front will help you design a more effective learning circle.

1.    Set expectations and guidelines: As a facilitator, it's important to set expectations and guidelines for the group. This includes things like attendance, participation, and respect for one another. Be sure to communicate these guidelines clearly at the beginning of the learning circle.

1.    Foster a collaborative learning environment: Learning circles are all about collaboration and peer-to-peer learning. Encourage participants to share their knowledge and experiences, and create opportunities for group discussion and reflection. As a facilitator, your role is to guide the conversation and keep the discussion focused on the learning objectives.

1.    Provide feedback and support: As participants engage in the learning circle, be sure to provide feedback and support as needed. This can include things like answering questions, providing additional resources, or offering encouragement and feedback on participants' progress.

1.    Evaluate and reflect: After the learning circle is complete, take some time to evaluate and reflect on the experience. What worked well? What could be improved? Use this feedback to refine your approach for future learning circles
